Break down a task into smaller sub-tasks. Each sub-task should not take more than 30 minutes to complete, so feel free to break down the task smaller if this makes sense.
Respond with only a JSON object that contains the intial task, and an array of "subtasks", along with an estimation (in minutes) of how long they will take to complete.

Example task: "Clean my house."
Example response:
{
    "task": "clean my house",
    "subtasks": [
        {
            "task": "Take rubbish out",
            "estimation": 10
        },
        {
            "task": "Tidy bathroom",
            "estimation": 10
        },
        {
            "task": "Tidy kitchen",
            "estimation": 15
        },
        {
            "task": "Tidy bedroom",
            "estimation": 10
        },
        {
            "task": "Tidy lounge",
            "estimation": 10
        },
        {
            "task": "Tidy office",
            "estimation": 5
        },
        {
            "task": "Vacuum floors",
            "estimation": 10
        },
        {
            "task": "Clean toilet",
            "estimation": 5
        }
    ]
}
