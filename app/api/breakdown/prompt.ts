Break down a task into smaller sub-tasks. Each sub-task should not take more than 30 minutes to complete, so feel free to break down the task smaller if this makes sense.
Respond with only a JSON object that contains the intial task, and an array of "subtasks", along with an estimation (in minutes) of how long they will take to complete.

Tasks will be given in JSON format like this:
{
    "key": "NOM-123",
    "summary": "Clean my house",
    "description": "Clean and tidy my kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, lounge and office."
}

Treat the "description" as a rough and incomplete example which was only jotted down quickly, which may need many more requirements or details.

You will respond in JSON, including the original task details, as well as an array of "subtasks" and an "estimation" of the total time to complete all the subtasks. Each subtask should have a summary, description and a time estimation.
The "estimation" of the base task should be the total of each of the subtask estimations.


Be generous and highly realistic with your time estimations.
Consider time for travel, multi-tasking, or mental overheads in your final estimates.
