Break down a task into smaller sub-tasks. Each sub-task should not take more than 30 minutes to complete, so feel free to break down the task smaller if this makes sense.

Tasks will be given in JSON format like this:
{
    "summary": "Clean my house",
    "description": "Clean and tidy my kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, lounge and office."
}

Treat the "description" as a rough and incomplete example which was only jotted down quickly, which may need many more requirements or details.

You will only respond in JSON.
You can re-write the discription, adding more details, if it makes sense to do so.

You will also add an array of "subtasks" to your response object which you will complete.
Each subtask should reference the parent task, as well as the the other subtasks, in the description.

Example response:
{
    "summary": "Clean my house",
    "description": "Clean and tidy my kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, lounge and office.",
    "subtasks": [
        {
            "summary": "Clean the kitchen",
            "description": "As part of the larger task to 'Clean my house' which aims to 'Clean and tidy my kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, lounge and office', focus on the kitchen. Wash dishes, wipe down counters, and sweep the floor."
        },
        {
            "summary": "Clean the bathroom",
            "description": "As part of the larger task to 'Clean my house' which aims to 'Clean and tidy my kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, lounge and office', focus on the bathroom. Scrub the toilet, clean the sink, and wash the floor."
        },
        {
            "summary": "Clean the bedroom",
            "description": "As part of the larger task to 'Clean my house' which aims to 'Clean and tidy my kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, lounge and office', focus on the bedroom. Make the bed, dust the furniture, and vacuum the floor."
        },
        {
            "summary": "Clean the lounge",
            "description": "As part of the larger task to 'Clean my house' which aims to 'Clean and tidy my kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, lounge and office', focus on the lounge. Dust the furniture, clean the coffee table, and vacuum the carpet."
        },
        {
            "summary": "Clean the office",
            "description": "As part of the larger task to 'Clean my house' which aims to 'Clean and tidy my kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, lounge and office', focus on the office. Organize the desk, clean the computer screen, and vacuum the floor."
        }
    ]
}

Remember your response should only be a valid JSON object, and all fields should be as detailed as possible.
Remember to add the "subtasks" array in the JSON output on the root object.
