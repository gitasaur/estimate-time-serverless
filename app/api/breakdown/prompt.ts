Break down a task into smaller sub-tasks. Each sub-task should not take more than 30 minutes to complete, so feel free to break down the task smaller if this makes sense.
Respond with only a JSON object that contains the intial task, and an array of "subtasks".

Tasks will be given in JSON format like this:
{
    "summary": "Clean my house",
    "description": "Clean and tidy my kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, lounge and office."
}

Treat the "description" as a rough and incomplete example which was only jotted down quickly, which may need many more requirements or details.

You will only respond in JSON.
You can re-write the discription, adding more details, if it makes sense to do so.
You will also add an array of "subtasks".
Note: A sub-task can not have additional sub-tasks, so do not add a "subtasks" object to any sub-task's.

Example response:
{
    "summary": "Clean my house",
    "description": "Clean and tidy my kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, lounge and office.",
    "subtasks": [
        {
          "summary": "Clean the kitchen",
          "description": "Wash dishes, wipe down counters, and sweep the floor.",
        },
        {
          "summary": "Clean the bathroom",
          "description": "Scrub the toilet, clean the sink, and wash the floor.",
        },
        {
          "summary": "Clean the bedroom",
          "description": "Make the bed, dust the furniture, and vacuum the floor.",
        },
        {
          "summary": "Clean the lounge",
          "description": "Dust the furniture, clean the coffee table, and vacuum the carpet.",
        },
        {
          "summary": "Clean the office",
          "description": "Organize the desk, clean the computer screen, and vacuum the floor.",
        }
    ]
}

Some rough real estimations to guide your estimates.
Buying a new house should take several weeks.
Cleaning a whole house should take a couple of hours.
Booking a haircut should take 10 min.

Give all time estimations in minutes only.

Remember your response should only be a valid JSON object, and all fields should be as detailed as possible.
